# Bedrock Pack Schema
The Java classes in this module are auto-generated from the `generator` module. **No changes should be made in this module as they will be overridden.**

The JSON schema used to construct these Java objects can be found at [Blockception/Minecraft-bedrock-json-schemas](https://github.com/Blockception/Minecraft-bedrock-json-schemas)
